The codebase origin goes back to 2000, when
it was developed under Linux OS.
Then in 2001 it was ported to Window 2000 Pro.
Since 2001 we had no time and requests
to port the codebase back to Linux again.
So the codebase now require al lot of 
#ifdef WIN32 or #ifdef UNIX to compile again on Linux.

I am looking for volunteers interested in porting it back to Linux.
