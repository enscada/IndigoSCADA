- Implement dinamic alarm and event lists, now alarm list is static

- Softlogic: improve Calculated.dll

- Porting of GUI of IndigoSCADA to QT version 4.x.x

- Porting to current Linux distributions

- Upgrade the realtime and historical databases to current versions

- Update documentation 

- Translate user interface, contribution needed

- Remove dependecy on STL std::map, so looking for a stable implemention of red-black trees
  (we plan to use kazlib or libds-2.2)
  kazlib is already used as an efficient alternative to the C++ map template in numerous places in the code base
  of other projects
  
- Use CMake build system - http://www.cmake.org/ or qmake
