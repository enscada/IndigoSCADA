IndigoSCADA list of TO DO on 22-05-2011

- Reimplement the GUI interface in general and in particular the HMI interface.
  Up to now IndigoSCADA does not support drag and drop for HMI widgets,
  it is time to add support for it.

- Implement dinamic alarm and event lists, now alarm list is static

- Softlogic: improve Calculated.dll

- Porting of GUI of IndigoSCADA to QT version 4.x.x

- Porting to current Linux distributions

- Porting to Symbian(?)

- Upgrade the realtime and historical databases to current versions

- Update documentation 

- Translate user interface, contribution needed

- Remove dependecy on STL std::map, so looking for a stable implemention of red-black trees
  (we plan to use kazlib or libds-2.2)
  kazlib is already used as an efficient alternative to the C++ map template in numerous places in the code base
  of other projects
  
- Use CMake build system - http://www.cmake.org/ or qmake

- Make reports in xml format
