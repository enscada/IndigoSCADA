IndigoSCADA list of TO DO on 26-09-2011

- Porting of GUI of IndigoSCADA to QT version 4.x.x

- Implement configurator, where configuration files are in in .xls format, use ExcelFormat to read,
  or .xml format, use TinyXML to read

- Reimplement the GUI interface in general and in particular the HMI interface.

- Implement dinamic alarm and event lists, now alarm list is static

- Softlogic: improve Calculated.dll

- Porting to current Linux distributions

- Upgrade the realtime and historical databases to current versions

- Update documentation 

- Translate user interface, contribution needed

- Remove dependecy on STL std::map, so looking for a stable implemention of red-black trees
  (we plan to use kazlib or libds-2.2)
  kazlib is already used as an efficient alternative to the C++ map template in numerous places in the code base
  of other projects
  
- Use CMake build system - http://www.cmake.org/ or qmake

- Make reports in .xml format, use TinyXML to write
- Make reports in .xls format, use ExcelFormat to write
