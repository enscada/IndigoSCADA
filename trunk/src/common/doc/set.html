<h2>
SET and BAG</h2>
Sets and bags is data structures that hold an unlimited number of elements.
The only difference between them is that the elements in a set are unique,
while a bag might hold a multiple copy of the same element. Each has its
uses. I shall refer to the set only in this discussion, highlighting any
differences with a bag if applicable.
<p>A&nbsp;set is a collection of elements. Operations that are of interest
with sets are <tt>UNION</tt> of two sets which computes the union of the
two sets (it combines them) to produce a new set that contains the elements
of the original two sets; <tt>CONTAINS</tt>, which check if a set contains
a particular element; <tt>INTERSECT</tt>, which computes the intersection
of the two sets (those elements that are contained in both sets); <tt>XINTERSECT</tt>,
which computes the inverse intersection of the two sets&nbsp;(those elements
that are <b>not</b> contained in both sets); and <tt>DIFFERENCE</tt>, which
computes the difference betweeen two sets, defined as those elements of
the first set that are <b>not</b> contained in the second set.
<h3>
<a NAME="intro"></a><font color="#3366FF">Introduction</font></h3>
LibDS has a single data type to represent both a set and a bag: the
<tt>SET</tt>,
although you can use <tt>BAG</tt>&nbsp;as an alias (beware though, LibDS
does not actually check if a <tt>BAG</tt>&nbsp;is really a <tt>BAG</tt>,
this is just a semantic convenience). Since a set needs to keep track of
whether the elements it contains are unique, a LibDS <tt>SET</tt> needs
as comparison function to be passed to it at init time. This function is
type <tt>SETCMPFUN</tt>, which is declared as <tt>int(*)(void*,void*)</tt>.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The convention in this case is that the comparison function returns 1 if
the compared elements are equal, and 0 otherwise (i.e. we <b>do not</b>
require that elements in a set can be ordered). In addition a <tt>SET</tt>
must be told to ensure disjointness (force that elements that are added
to the <tt>SET</tt> are not in it yet). NOTE: the elements are not compared
by LibDS! You need to define an own comparison function, and the LibDS
<tt>SET</tt> itself has no notion of keys, as does the <tt>AVLTREE</tt>
or the <tt>HEAP</tt>. This is left entirely to the caller's discretion.
<p>Note on efficiency:&nbsp;if the elements of the set <b>can</b> be ordered,
then you can make LibDS use a more efficient representation, by providing
a flag at set creation time (see below), and using a comparison function
that returns -1 if the first parameter is smaller than the second, 0 if
both parameters are equal, and 1 if the first parameter is larger than
the second. Beware of some special cases, as explained below.
<p>The difference between a <tt>SET</tt> and a <tt>BAG</tt> is determined
by a single parameter, <i>ensure_disjoint</i> in the creation routine given
below.
<h3>
<a NAME="init"></a><font color="#3366FF">Initialization</font></h3>
<tt><font color="#000000">SET <b>setMake</b>(void)</font></tt>
<p>Create a new set. The set will not check for disjointness so it is in
fact a <tt>BAG</tt>. Furthermore, no comparison function is assigned to
the new set.
<p><tt>SET <b>setNew</b>(SETCMPFUN <i>f</i>,int <i>ensure_disjoint</i>,int
<i>ord</i>)</tt>
<p>Creates a new set. The comparison function is <i>f</i>, and if you want
to ensure disjointness (i.e. use this as a <tt>SET</tt> rather than a <tt>BAG</tt>),
set <i><tt>ensure_disjoint</tt></i> to true. If this is the case, then
you can also set <i><tt>ord</tt></i> to anything else but 0, to let LibDS
know that the elements can be ordered (like numbers or strings).&nbsp;In
this case, LibDS expects <i>f</i> to behave as the C function <tt>strcmp()</tt>:
that is, return -1 if the first element is smaller than the second, 1 if
the first element is larger than the second, and zero otherwise. If <i><tt>ensure_disjoint</tt></i>
is 0, then the <i><tt>ord</tt></i> flag is ignored, and f should behave
as the set comparison function mentioned in the Introduction to this page.
<p><a NAME="close"></a><font color="#3366FF">Closing</font><font color="#3366FF"></font>
<p><tt><font color="#000000">void <b>setClose</b>(SET <i>set</i>)</font></tt>
<p><font color="#000000">Close the set, releasing all memory it was using.
User data is left untouched.</font>
<p><tt><font color="#000000">void <b>setCloseWithFunction</b>(SET <i>set</i>,void
(*<i>fun</i>)(void*))</font></tt>
<p><font color="#000000">Close the set and call <i>fun</i> on each data
in the set.</font>
<h3>
<a NAME="adding"></a><font color="#3366FF">Adding</font></h3>
<tt><font color="#000000">int <b>setAdd</b>(SET <i>set</i>,void *<i>data</i>)</font></tt>
<p>Adds this element to the set. If the set was created with <i>ensure_disjoint</i>
set to true (i.e. a true <tt>SET</tt>), then the element will not be added
if it is already in the set. If <i>ensure_disjoint</i> is false, then the
element is blindly added to the set (this is the <tt>BAG</tt> behavior).
Returns 0 on success, -1 on failure.
<h3>
<a NAME="deleting"></a><font color="#3366FF">Deleting</font></h3>
<tt><font color="#000000">void* <b>setRemove</b>(SET <i>set</i>,void *
<i>key</i>)</font></tt>
<p><font color="#000000">Removes the element that matches the given <i><tt>key</tt></i>.
Returns the given element, or <tt>NULL</tt> on error (if element was not
found in the given <i><tt>set</tt></i>).</font>
<h3>
<a NAME="fetching"></a><font color="#3366FF">Fetching</font></h3>
<tt><font color="#000000">int <b>setContains</b>(SET <i>set</i>,void *<i>elt</i>)</font></tt>
<p><font color="#000000">Returns true if this <i>set</i> contains the element
<i>elt</i>.
This will only work if a comparison function has been given.</font>
<p><tt><font color="#000000">void * <b>setFind</b>(SET <i>set</i>,void
*<i>elt</i>)</font></tt>
<p><font color="#000000">Find the element in this <i>set</i> that is equal
to the <i>elt</i> passed. If nothing is found, <tt>NULL</tt> is returned.
This will only work if a comparison function has been passed to the <tt>SET</tt>.</font>
<p><tt><font color="#000000">void * <b>setFirst</b>(SET <i>set</i>)</font></tt>
<p><font color="#000000">Returns the first element in this set. "First"
in this case can be arbitrary. Returns <tt>NULL</tt> if nothing is in the
set.</font>
<p><tt><font color="#000000">void * <b>setNext</b>(SET <i>set</i>)</font></tt>
<p><font color="#000000">Returns the arbitrary next element in the set.
If <tt>setFirst()</tt> has not been called prior to this function, then
its effect is identical to <tt>setFirst()</tt>.</font>
<h3>
<a NAME="parameters"></a><font color="#3366FF">Parameters</font></h3>
<tt><font color="#000000">int <b>setSize</b>(SET <i>set</i>)</font></tt>
<p><font color="#000000">Returns the number of items currently in the set.</font>
<p><tt><font color="#000000">int <b>setEmpty</b>(SET <i>set</i>)</font></tt>
<p><font color="#000000">Returns 0 if the set still has items in it, 1
if it is empty.</font>
<h3>
<a NAME="advanced"></a><font color="#3366FF">Advanced functionality</font></h3>
<font color="#000000">These are the most <tt>SET</tt>-ish operations of
all the ones described on this page.&nbsp; The presuppose that the two
sets are compatible: this means, they contain the same kind of elements.
The restriction is not that big, however: all this means is that the comparison
functions of the sets are capable on operating on all types of elements
present in either set.</font><font color="#000000"></font>
<p><font color="#000000">In all cases, a new set is created and returned.
Upon failure, these functions return <tt>NULL</tt>.</font>
<p><tt><font color="#000000">SET <b>setAppend</b>(SET <i>s1</i>,SET <i>s2</i>)</font></tt>
<br><tt><font color="#000000">SET <b>setUnion</b>(SET <i>s1</i>,SET <i>s2</i>)</font></tt>
<p><font color="#000000">NOTE: <tt>setAppend()</tt> is just an alias for
<tt>setUnion()</tt>.</font>
<br><font color="#000000">This function makes a new set that is the union
of the two sets given. The second set is left untouched, while the first
set now contains the elements of both <i>s1</i> and <i>s2</i>. If any elements
is <i>s2</i> were already in <i>s1</i> and <i>s1</i> was created with <i>ensure_disjoint
</i>set
to true, no duplicates will result, else elements of <i>s2</i> are added
blindly to <i>s1</i>, which might lead to duplicates. The representative
of the new set is the representative of <i>s1</i> prior to this operation.
NOTE: </font>This is in fact equivalent to simpy adding all the elements
of <i>s2</i> into <i>s1</i> and then getting rid of <i>s2</i>.
<p><tt><font color="#000000">SET <b>setUnion1</b>(SET <i>s1</i>,SET <i>s2</i>)</font></tt>
<p><font color="#000000">Same as <tt>setUnion()</tt> only now <i>s1</i>
and <i>s2</i> are left untouched, and a completely new set is created and
returned. The new set inherits the parameters of <i>s1</i>.</font>
<p><tt><font color="#000000">SET <b>setIntersect</b>(SET <i>s1</i>,SET
<i>s2</i>)</font></tt>
<p><font color="#000000">Computes the intersection of the two sets. This
will only work if <b>at least<i> </i></b><i><tt>s2</tt> </i>has a comparison
function. This is so because this function checks to see if an element
in <i><tt>s1</tt></i> is contained within <i><tt>s2</tt></i>, and only
then assigns it to the resulting set. Consequently, <i><tt>s2</tt></i>
must be able to compare elements. As usual, <tt>NULL</tt> is returned upon
failure.</font>
<p><tt><font color="#000000">SET <b>setXIntersect</b>(SET <i>s1</i>,SET
<i>s2</i>)</font></tt>
<p>Computes the exclusive intersection of the two sets. This means, the
resulting set contains all the elements of the two sets that are not contained
in both sets.&nbsp; I.e. if <i>A</i> contains 1,2,3,4 and <i>B</i> containes
3,4,5,6,7, after <tt>setXIntersect()</tt> the resulting set will contain
1,3,5,6,7. In contrast <tt>setIntersect()</tt> will produce a set that
contains 3,4.
<p><tt><font color="#000000">SET <b>setDifference</b>(SET <i>s1</i>,SET
<i>s2</i>)</font></tt>
<p>Compute the difference between <i><tt>s1</tt></i> and <i><tt>s2</tt></i>.
This is defined as those elements of <i><tt>s1</tt></i> that are not part
of <i><tt>s2</tt></i>.
