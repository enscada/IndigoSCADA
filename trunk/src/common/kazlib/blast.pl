# This is a program whose output can be piped to the test drivers for
# hash.c and dict.c. It inserts a bunch of data and then deletes it all.
#
# The $modulus should be a prime number. This ensures that the $modulus - 1
# generated keys are all distinct.  The $factor_i and $factor_d values need not
# be prime, but it should not be a multiple of $modulus (including zero),
# otherwise a sequence of duplicate keys will be generated: choose numbers
# in the range [1, $modulus - 1]. Choosing 1 means that
# insertions (or deletions) will take place in order.
# The purpose of using the prime modulus number is to generate a repeatable
# sequence of unique keys that is (possibly) not in sorted order.
