<h2>
AVL TREE</h2>
Here's the most authoritative documentation on the AVL Tree implementation
used in LibDS. Ignore any other files that might claim the same.
<h3>
<a NAME="intro"></a><font color="#3366FF">Introduction</font></h3>
An AVL tree is a data structure that is very well suited to storing data
that supports ordering, such as names, or other miscellaneous things. Due
to the fact that it is a balanced tree, very fast access to the data is
supported, including inserting, deleting, finding, determining the next,
previous, smallest and largest value, etc... Should you wish to learn more,
a host of books on data structures discuss these and other sundry features
of binary trees, as well as provide some rigorous proofs of the properties.
<p>The AVLTREE implementation of LibDS is a true type AVL Tree (i.e. it
supports all operations in 1.44*log <i>n</i> time). It currently supports
storage of void pointers and no duplicate values. You can store duplicates
by managing that yourself. It supports any type of key on which the comparison
operators "greater than", "smaller than" and "equal to" can be applied.
Key versatility is achieved by using a user-supplied comparison function.
The tree uses string keys of variable length, and <tt>strcmp()</tt> per
default. The tree can store pointers to keys, or make own copies, which
can be useful in certain cases, such as when filling with data from the
same dynamic pool.
<p>This implementation keeps all data in virtual memory.
<h3>
<a NAME="init"></a><font color="#3366FF">Initialization</font></h3>
<tt>AVLTREE <b>avlMake</b>(void)</tt>
<p>Makes a default AVL tree. Uses variable length C-strings as keys and
<tt>strcmp()</tt>
as compare function. This one is likely to be used the most.
<p><tt>AVLTREE <b>avlNewTree</b>(AVLKEYCOMPFUN <i>f</i>,int <i>copy_keys</i>,int
<i>key_size</i>)</tt>
<p>Makes an AVLTREE with <i>f</i> as comparison function. It has the type
<tt>AVLKEYCOMPFUN</tt>,
which is defined as <tt>int (*AVLKEYCOMPFUN)(DSKEY,DSKEY)</tt>. The argument
<i>copy_keys</i>
instruct LibDS to make copies of the keys and use those instead of the
pointers to the keys you pass it. It is useful in case where the pointer
you pass is always the same but the values it contains are different. If
LibDS needs to copy the keys and unless the keys are simple C-strings (i.e.
NULL-terminated strings) (in which case LibDS can determine the size of
the key itself), then <i>key_size</i> must be set to the actual size of
the keys. Copying keys is not necessary if the key pointers are never the
same.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
<a NAME="close"></a><font color="#3366FF">Closing</font></h3>
<tt>void <b>avlClose</b>(AVLTREE <i>tr</i>)</tt>
<p>Closes the given tree. This effectively means that all the nodes and
the memory associated with them is released. If keys have been copied,
then they are freed here as well. The data stored with each node is not
touched.
<p><tt>void <b>avlCloseWithFunction</b>(AVLTREE <i>tr</i>, void (*fun)(void*))</tt>
<p>Closes the tree. The effect is the same as <tt>avlClose()</tt>, only
this time as each node is visited to be freed, the function <i>fun</i>
will be applied to the data stored in the node. By passing your own version
of <i>fun</i> you can do things with the data before the tree is closed.
<p><b>NOTE</b>: the order in which the nodes are visited is undefined (i.e.
it might be pre-,post- or in-order). The idea is to use avlCloseWithFunction()
only for cleaning up purposes where the exact order in which the nodes
are visited is not important.
<h3>
<a NAME="adding"></a><font color="#3366FF">Adding</font></h3>
<tt>int <b>avlAdd</b>(AVLTREE <i>tr</i>,const DSKEY <i>key</i>,void *<i>data</i>)</tt>
<br><tt>int <b>avlInsert</b>(AVLTREE <i>tr</i>,const DSKEY <i>key</i>,void
*<i>data</i>)</tt>
<p>Adds the <i>data</i> to the tree <i>tr</i>. The data has the key <i>key</i>.
Both functions return -1 on failure, which only happens when a duplicate
key has been found. If the <i>key</i> was not found in the tree, then a
new node holding the data is added to the tree. On success 0 is returned.
<br>Adding an item sets the currency of the tree to the position in the
tree where the newly created item has been inserted.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
<a NAME="deleting"></a><font color="#3366FF">Deleting</font></h3>
<tt>void* <b>avlRemove</b>(AVLTREE <i>tr</i>,const DSKEY <i>key</i>)</tt>
<p>Removes the data with the given key. If the key is found, then the actual
data is returned. If the key is not found (i.e. no such item is present
in the tree), <tt>NULL</tt> is returned.
<br>Removing does not change the currency of the tree, <i>unless</i> the
item that was removed was the current item. In this case the currency is
lost.
<p><tt>void&nbsp;* <b>avlCut</b>(AVLTREE <i>tr</i>)</tt>
<p>Removes the current element from the tree. Returns the data stored with
that element. If no current element is present, this function fails. Upon
failure, <tt>NULL</tt>&nbsp;is returned. The currency in the tree is lost,
just as with <tt>avlRemove()</tt> above.
<h3>
<a NAME="fetching"></a><font color="#3366FF">Fetching</font></h3>
The functionality to retrieve data from the tree is quite extensive. Whenever
<tt>void*</tt>
is returned, it will contain the data requested, or <tt>NULL</tt> if the
data was not found (i.e. the tree did not contain that item).
<p><b>NOTE</b>: storing <tt>NULL</tt> in the tree will return <tt>NULL</tt>
whenever that item is requested. Whether or not that is an error will not
be immediately obvious.
<p><tt>void* <b>avlFind</b>(AVLTREE <i>tr</i>,const DSKEY <i>key</i>)</tt>
<p>Find the data with the given key and returns it. The currency of the
tree is set to this data item.
<p><tt>void* <b>avlFirst</b>(AVLTREE <i>tr</i>)</tt>
<br><tt>void* <b>avlMinimum</b>(AVLTREE <i>tr</i>)</tt>
<p>Returns the first item in the tree. The currency is set to the first
item in the tree if present.
<p><tt>void* <b>avlLast</b>(AVLTREE <i>tr</i>)</tt>
<br><tt>void* <b>avlMaximum</b>(AVLTREE <i>tr</i>)</tt>
<p>Returns the last item in the tree. The currency is set to the last item
in the tree if present.
<p><tt>void* <b>avlNext</b>(AVLTREE <i>tr</i>)</tt>
<p>Returns the next item in the tree. "Next" is defined as the item <i>after</i>
the current item in alphabetical order. By convention, if there's no current
item, the first item in the tree is returned.
<p><tt>void* <b>avlPrev</b>(AVLTREE <i>tr</i>)</tt>
<p>Returns the previous item in the tree. "Previous" is defined as the
item
<i>before</i> the current item in alphabetical order. By convention,
if there's no current item, the last item in the tree is returned.
<p><tt>void* <b>avlCurrent</b>(AVLTREE <i>tr</i>)</tt>
<p>Returns the current item in the tree. If no item is current, NULL is
returned.
<p><tt>int <b>avlSetCurrent</b>(AVLTREE <i>tr</i>,const DSKEY <i>key</i>)</tt>
<p>Sets the item that matches the given key as the current item in the
tree. If no such item was found the currency remains unchanged and -1 is
returned to indicate failure, otherwise 0 is returned to indicate success.
<p><tt>void <b>avlClearCurrent</b>(AVLTREE <i>tr</i>)</tt>
<p>Clears the current item in the tree. When this function returns the
tree has no current item. This function always succeeds.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
<a NAME="parameters"></a><font color="#3366FF">Tree Parameters</font></h3>
<tt><font color="#000000">int <b>avlHeight</b>(AVLTREE <i>tr</i>)</font></tt>
<p><font color="#000000">This function returns the height of the tree (its
depth in fact). Since the tree is an AVL tree the depth should be no larger
than</font>
<br><font color="#000000">1.44 log <i>n</i> (<i>n</i> being the total number
of nodes in the tree).</font>
<p><tt><font color="#000000">int <b>avlTotalNodes</b>(AVLTREE <i>tr</i>)</font></tt>
<p><tt><font color="#000000">int <b>avlSize</b>(AVLTREE <i>tr</i>)</font></tt>
<p><font color="#000000">Returns the total number of nodes currently in
the tree.</font>
<p><tt><font color="#000000">int <b>avlCheck</b>(AVLTREE <i>tr</i>)</font></tt>
<p><font color="#000000">This one performs a basic check to see if the
tree still conforms to the AVL properties, which are that given a node
in the tree, the heights of its left and right children should not differ
by more that one, and both children are themselves also AVL trees. The
function exits the program with some statistics about the errors found.
I can't see why you would want to run this function, unless you want to
double-check that this implementation does actually conform to the AVL
properties.</font>
<h3>
<a NAME="advanced"></a><font color="#3366FF">Advanced functionality</font></h3>
<font color="#000000">There's a few functions that allow sequential access
to all the nodes in the tree.</font>
<p><tt><font color="#000000">void <b>avlWalk</b>(AVLTREE <i>tr</i>,void
(*<i>fun</i>)(void *),int <i>type</i>)</font></tt>
<p><font color="#000000">This function performs a walk on the tree, calling
the function <i>fun</i> at each node with that node's data as argument.
If <tt>type</tt> </font>is
<br><tt>AVLInWalk</tt>, then the walk is an in-order walk of the tree.
If <tt>type</tt> is <tt>AVLPreWalk</tt>, the walk is a pre-order walk,
and if <tt>type</tt> is <tt>AVLPostWalk</tt>, then the walk is a post-order
walk.
<p><tt><font color="#000000">void <b>avlWalkAscending</b>(AVLTREE <i>tr</i>,void
(*<i>fun</i>)(void *))</font></tt>
<p><font color="#000000">This function visits all the nodes in the tree
according to their lexicographical order, starting at the lowest key. The
function</font>
<br><font color="#000000"><i>fun</i> is called at each node with the node's
data as argument. Note that you can do the same as follows:</font>
<p><tt><font color="#000000">for (data = avlFirst(tr); data; data = avlNext(tr))</font></tt>
<br><tt><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; process(data);</font></tt>
<p><tt><font color="#000000">void <b>avlWalkDescending</b>(AVLTREE <i>tr</i>,void
(*<i>fun</i>)(void *))</font></tt>
<p><font color="#000000">This function does the same as <tt>avlWalkAscending</tt>(),
but starts at the highest key and works its way down to the lowest. The
same effect can be achieved through:</font>
<p><tt><font color="#000000">for (data = avlLast(tr); data; data = avlPrev(tr))</font></tt>
<br><tt><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; process(data);</font></tt>
<p><tt><font color="#000000">void* <b>avlUpdateData</b>(AVLTREE <i>tr</i>,DSKEY
<i>key</i>,void
*<i>new_data</i>)</font></tt>
<p><font color="#000000">This function finds the data item identified by
the key argument and replaces it with the new data given. The old data
is returned, unless the key was not found in the tree, in which case NULL
is returned.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
<a NAME="obscure"></a><font color="#3366FF">Obscure functionality</font></h3>
There's a whole family of functions that work on <tt>AVLNODE</tt>s instead
of the data in the tree, but I advise you not to use them even though they
do the same things as the functions given above. I can't think of a reason
why they should be exported at all. In any case, I won't document them
here.
