HASH TABLE</h2>

<h3>
<a NAME="intro"></a><font color="#3366FF">Introduction</font></h3>
Using a heap or a balanced binary tree to store and retrieve data is a
very fast and efficient way to deal with data that needs to be sorted in
one way or another. We know that construction of a heap or binary tree
is of the order of O(<i>n </i>lg <i>n</i>), while data access can happen
in O(lg <i>n</i>), <i>n</i> being the number of data items stored in the
data structure. These limits are lower limits, and as long as key comparisons
are required in order to access the data, we know that they cannot be made
lower (I won't go about giving the proof here, check out a book on this
if you need the exact proof).
<p>But, strictly speaking, we don't always <i>need</i> to store data in
any particular order, nor do we need to sort it. If we don't need to sort
the data, then we can dispense with the need for key comparisons, and can
in fact make data access much faster. This is the principle behind using
a table: you can access any element of the table in O(1), which is <b>independent</b>
of the number of data elements contained in it. With a lot of elements
and frequent data access, we can achieve some noticeable speed differences
this way.
<p>Mapping a data element with a key to a location in the table is achieved
by using a hash function. A hash function will always map a given key to
a particular location in the table. Accessing the element simply means
run its key through the hash function and read the table index that the
function returned. From here stems the advantage in speed over a balance
binary tree.
<p>LibDS refers to a hashtable as a <tt>HASHTABLE</tt>. In the current
implementation, a hash table is represented by a fixed size array, while collisions
are resolved through chaining. Keys are as usual of type <tt>DSKEY</tt>.
You need to define your own hash function, and hash key comparison function
(by now this should sound familiar). However, since strings are quite often
used as keys, LibDS provides a default hash and hash comparison function
that work on C-strings.
<p>As usual, items stored in the hash table are <tt>void</tt> pointers
to actual user data.
<p>All data is stored in virtual memory.
<h3>
<a NAME="init"></a><font color="#3366FF">Initialization</font></h3>
<tt><font color="#000000">HASHTABLE <b>htMake</b>(int <i>size</i>)</font></tt>
<p>Creates a default hash table of size <i>size</i>. Passing a value for
<i>size</i>
smaller than 1 lets LibDS choose a default value, normally something in
the order of less than a 1000 elements. There is some debate whether the
size should be a primary number or not, which can supposedly reflect on
the amount of collisions that will occur. Experiment with this to find
out.
<br>The default hash table assumes C-strings as keys, and uses a predefined
hash function. If you got a better function, see the next function on how
to tell LibDS to use that instead.
<p><tt>HASHTABLE <b>htMakeHashTable</b>(int <i>size</i>,HASHFUNC <i>hashfun</i>,HASHCMPFUNC
<i>cmpfun</i>)</tt>
<br><tt>typedef unsigned int (*HASHFUNC)(DSKEY);</tt>
<br><tt>typedef int (*HASHCMPFUNC)(DSKEY,DSKEY);</tt>
<p><font color="#000000">Creates a new hash table. It has a size of <i>size</i>,
and uses the given functions for hashing and comparing the keys. LibDS
assumes a key of 32 bits, so <i>hashfun</i> must return a 32-bit unsigned
value. Comparing the keys is necessary only when LibDS is resolving collisions,
and <i>cmpfun</i> is expected to return -1 when the first key is smaller
than the second, 0 when the two keys are equal, and 1 whenever the second
key is larger than the first.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">Upon success, the above functions return a valid
<tt>HASHTABLE</tt>
pointer. If they fail, <tt>NULL</tt> is returned.</font>
<h3>
<a NAME="close"></a><font color="#3366FF">Closing</font></h3>
<tt><font color="#000000">void <b>htClose</b>(HASHTABLE <i>hashtable</i>)</font></tt>
<p><font color="#000000">Closes the hash table, effectively releasing all
memory used by it. User data remains untouched.</font>
<p><tt><font color="#000000">void <b>htCloseWithFunction</b>(HASHTABLE
<i>hashtable</i>,void
(*<i>fun</i>)(void*))</font></tt>
<p><font color="#000000">Closes the hashtable, only this time call the
function
<i>fun</i> on each data element in the table as it is being closed.</font>
<h3>
<a NAME="adding"></a><font color="#3366FF">Adding</font></h3>
<tt>int <b>htAdd</b>(HASHTABLE <i>table</i>,DSKEY <i>key</i>,void *<i>data</i>)</tt>
<p>Adds a new element with key <i>key</i> to the hashtable. The function
returns 0 on success, -1 on failure. Failure is signalled whenever a duplicate
key is detected, or there is a memory allocation problem.
<h3>
<a NAME="deleting"></a><font color="#3366FF">Deleting</font></h3>
<tt>void* <b>htRemove</b>(HASHTABLE <i>table</i>,DSKEY <i>key</i>)</tt>
<p>Delete the element with the given <i>key</i> from the hash table.
<h3>
<a NAME="fetching"></a><font color="#3366FF">Fetching</font></h3>
<font color="#000000">As usual, whenever a <tt>void*</tt> is returned,
it contains user data, or <tt>NULL</tt> if something went wrong. Therefore,
storing <tt>NULL</tt> as a value will not be distinguished from an error.</font>
<p><tt>void * <b>htFind</b>(HASHTABLE <i>table</i>,DSKEY <i>key</i>)</tt>
<p><font color="#000000">Return the element with the given <i>key</i>.
Fails if the key is not in the table.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
<a NAME="parameters"></a><font color="#3366FF">Parameters</font></h3>
<tt>int <b>htSize</b>(HASHTABLE <i>table</i>)</tt>
<p>Return the size of the table. This is equal to the argument passed to
the <tt>htMake*()</tt> functions, unless that argument was -1, in which
case this function returns the actual size LibDS selected for the table.
Does not fail.
<p><tt>int <b>htItems</b>(HASHTABLE <i>table</i>)</tt>
<p>Returns the actual number of items currently stored in the table. Never
fails.
<p><tt>int <b>htConflicts</b>(HASHTABLE <i>table</i>)</tt>
<p>Returns the number of conflicts (items that are mapped to the same location
in the table). Never failes.
<p><tt>int <b>htEmpty</b>(HASHTABLE <i>table</i>)</tt>
<p>Returns true (value not equal to zero) if the table has no (more) elements.
Else, false (value equal to zero) is returned. (Equivalent to <tt>htItems()
== 0</tt>).
<h3>
<a NAME="advanced"></a><font color="#3366FF">Advanced funtionality</font></h3>

<h4>
Visiting the elements of a HASHTABLE</h4>
You can visit all elements in the hash table and call a function to be
performed on each data item found in each element.
<p><tt>void <b>htWalk</b>(HASHTABLE <i>table</i>,int <i>all</i>,void (*<i>fun</i>)(DSKEY
<i>key</i>,void * <i>data</i>,int <i>is_conflict</i>))</tt>
<p>Visits all the elements in the table (in <b>no predefined</b> order),
and calls <i>fun</i> on each element found. The function receives as first
argument the key of the element. As second argument the user data that
was stored with the element is passed. The third argument is non-zero if
the current element is a <i>conflict of the previous one</i>. The third
argument is zero if the current element is not conflicting with any other
elements. If <i>all</i> is true (not equal to zero), all elements are visited.
If <i>all</i> is equal to zero, only the conflicting elements are visited.
<p><b>NOTE</b>: <tt>htWalk()</tt> will happily visit all slots in the hashtable,
<i>including those that are empty</i>. Therefore, it is not ideal for sequential
access to your data.
