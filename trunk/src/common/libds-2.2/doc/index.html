<p>This page contains the documentation for LibDS, a data structures library
written in ANSI C. LibDS was written by Peter Bozarov.
<h3>
<a NAME="intro"></a>Introduction</h3>
LibDS is a data structures library. It is a collection of useful data structures
and functions to manipulate them. LibDS has been designed to be as generic
as possible, which basically means that all the details about the implementation
have been hidden, and that the interface has been made as consistent as
possible between all the different data structures.
<h3>
<a NAME="history"></a>History</h3>
I started working on LibDS in 1999. I was reading a book on data structures
and came across the topic on binary trees, which described how useful they
were. The book gave a description of a binary tree implementation that
guarantees that the tree will remain almost balance at all times, even
after multiple insertion/deletion operations. Those of use versed in binary
tree theory know that the efficiency of the operations that a binary tree
supports depends directly on the depth of the tree. Keeping the depth to
a minimum (which amounts to keeping the tree as balanced as possible) ensures
fast tree operations. The tree implemetation in question was called an
AVL tree, and its maximum depth could be proven to be 1.44log(<i>n</i>),
with <i>n</i> being the number of nodes in the tree. This inspired me.
(Well, if you're reading this then you're into computers so you realize
that such things <i>can</i> actually inspire people). There was a data
structure which supported addition, deletion, and searching of data in
O(log <i>n</i>) time, with <i>n</i> being the number of data items in the
tree. I sensed that such a data structure can be a very powerful thing,
and decided to write my own implementation. (Yes, reinventing the wheel
and all, but, hey, I was learning to program anyway.) Well, to make a long
story short, LibDS grew out of this original AVL tree implementation. At
various times afterwards I came accross the need for a queue, a stack and
a variable array, and I just added them to the original avl tree, to produce
a collection of data structures.
<p>So, here it is then.
<h3>
<a NAME="overview"></a>Overview</h3>
The way LibDS works is designed to be very simple and intuitive. (Whether
that <i>is</i> the case will remain to be seen.) Here is a short overview.
<h4>
Storing data</h4>
All the data structures that are found in the library store void pointers
to some user provided data. Those data structures that need to perform
key comparisons have to also be passed a key that uniquely identifies the
data item stored. The key can be anything, from a variable length string,
to binary keys of any size and type. There's a catch, however, to using
anything else than a string as key: you need to define the comparison operators
yourself. LibDS has support for this: you simply need to pass your own
function that performs the comparisons at initialization time. The function
must have the type
<tt>int compare(DSKEY k1,DSKEY k2)</tt>, and it must
return a value less than 0 if k1 is smaller than k2, a value exactly equal
to 0 if k1 is equal to k2, and a value larger than 0 if k1 is larger than
k2. You can cast the DSKEY to the appropriate data type that your keys
have. Should you choose to use strings as keys, then LibDS will simply
use the C function <tt>strcmp()</tt>, so make sure the keys are NULL terminated.
If they are not, for whatever reason, use an own function.
<h4>
Accessing data</h4>
LibDS has a generic interface for each data structure type that allows
access to the user data stored with the data structure in question. Here,
we will refer to them in their generic names, see the doc page for the
particular data type to see the exact function name and signature. (As
we said, the function signatures have been made as similar as possible,
to simplify the use of the library.) Also, not all data structures support
all of the operations defined below, again refer to the particular doc
page for more details
<p>LibDS supports the following operations on some user data D, a user
data key K, and a data structure S (for structures that do not need a key,
the function is the same, but without the key argument, except for items
with *):
<table>
<tr>
<td>ADD(S,K,D)</td>

<td>Adds and item with key K to S.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>REMOVE(S,K)&nbsp;</td>

<td>Remove the item in S that has key K</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>FIND(S,K,D)*</td>

<td>Find the item in S that has the key K</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>FIRST(S)</td>

<td>Get the first item in S</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>LAST(S)</td>

<td>Get the last item in S</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>NEXT(S)</td>

<td>Get the next item in S</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>PREV(S)</td>

<td>Get the previous item in S</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>CURR(S)</td>

<td>Get the current item in S</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>CLEARCURR(S)</td>

<td>Clears the current item in S</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>There are more functions, but most of them are specific to the data
structure used, so check with the appropriate pages below.
<p>LibDS supports the notion of currency. This basically means that it
keeps track the position in the data structure upon which the last operation
was performed. Currently, the currency is updated by the ADD(), FIND(),
FIRST(), LAST(), NEXT(), PREV() and CURR() functions. REMOVE() won't change
the currency. This is not a design flaw or feature, it's just how it is.
Consequently, depending on experience this might change in the near future.&nbsp;<a NAME="ds"></a>
<h3>
The data structures</h3>
There are currently five data structures present in LibDS. Check with the
appropriate pages here for more extensive documentation on how to use them
exactly.
<p><b>NOTE</b>: All the <b>Obscure Functionality</b> sections in these
pages document functionality which is exactly what the name says: obscure.
This type of functionality can be changed without prior notice, or any
form of backwards compatibility. Its there for the show...
