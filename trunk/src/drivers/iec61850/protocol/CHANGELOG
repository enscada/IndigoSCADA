- improved server side support for reporting. Reports can now contain TimeOfEntry values. The server now
respects most of the options for reports set by the client.
- added Semaphore functions to HAL API (thread.h). Semaphores are used by the server stack for internal
synchonization.
- fixed bugs in code that is responsible for remote access to report control blocks.
- fixed bug in COTP code when TPDU size is larger than 1024 bytes. TPDU size can now be as large as 16384 bytes.
- fixed bug in Hal_getTimeInMs function for Windows. Window filetime value will now be correctly converted.
- fixed problems with read access to complex array types (arrays of constructed attribute classes).

Changes to version 0.3.1
------------------------
- improved support for reporting - more options are possible, reason code can be included in reports
- basic support for control model (operate) in server and server API
- added server example for control model (server_example3)

Changes to version 0.3

- SCL file parser supports buffered and unbuffered report control blocks
- server support for unbuffered reporting (supported triggers are GI, integrity and value update)
- MMS client support for MMS information reports
- MMS stack supports fragmented transmission for MMS getNameList service
- new structure for examples directory -> each example is in its own directory and has its own Makefile
- server support for additional ACSI types -> better support for IEC 61850 data models
- server enforces write access restrictions to the IEC 61850 data model based on functional constraints.
- added support for TCP keepalive

- Changed handling of MMS GetNameList service in MMS client API

Changes to version 0.1.1
-------------------------
- a template project and makefile to simplify getting started with the library.
