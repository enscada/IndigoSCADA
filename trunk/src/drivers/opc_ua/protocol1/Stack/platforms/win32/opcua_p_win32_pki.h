                                          Depending on the PKIFlags set for the PKIProvider it uses the certificate store of the 
                                          current user (CERT_SYSTEM_STORE_CURRENT_USER), the machine-wide store (CERT_SYSTEM_STORE_LOCAL_MACHINE) 
                                          or the store associated to the running services (CERT_SYSTEM_STORE_SERVICES).

                                            - "CA" (i.e. Trusted Root Certification Authorities folder, Windows 2000 or later),
                                            - "Trust" (i.e. Enterprise Trust folder, Windows 2000 or later),
                                            - "UserDS" (i.e. ActiveDirectory User Object folder, Windows 2000 or later),
                                            - "TrustedPublisher" (i.e. Trusted Publishers folder, Windows XP or later),
                                            - "Disallowed" (i.e. Un-trusted Certificates; Windows XP or later),
                                            - "AuthRoot" (i.e. Third-Party Root Certification Authorities; Windows XP or later) or
                                            - "TrustedPeople" (i.e. Trusted People; Windows XP or later).
