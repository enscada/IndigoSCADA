/**
 * Networking
 * ----------
 * Client-server connection is represented by a `UA_Connection` structure. In
 * order to allow for different operating systems and connection types. For
 * this, `UA_Connection` stores a pointer to user-defined data and
 * function-pointers to interact with the underlying networking implementation.
 *
 * An example networklayer for TCP communication is contained in the plugins
 * folder. The networklayer forwards messages with `UA_Connection` structures to
 * the main open62541 library. The library can then return messages vie TCP
 * without being aware of the underlying transport technology.
