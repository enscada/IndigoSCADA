 * Services
 * ========
 *
 * In OPC UA, all communication is based on service calls, each consisting of a
 * request and a response message. These messages are defined as data structures
 * with a binary encoding and listed in :ref:`generated-types`. Since all
 * Services are pre-defined in the standard, they cannot be modified by the
 * user. But you can use the :ref:`Call <method-services>` service to invoke
 * user-defined methods on the server.
 *
 * The following service signatures are internal and *not visible to users*.
 * Still, we present them here for an overview of the capabilities of OPC UA.
 * Please refer to the :ref:`client` and :ref:`server` API where the services
 * are exposed to end users. Please see part 4 of the OPC UA standard for the
 * authoritative definition of the service and their behaviour. */
