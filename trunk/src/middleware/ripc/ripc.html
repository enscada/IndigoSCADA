<H2><A NAME = "about">About RIPC</A></H2>

RIPC is library providing interprocess synchronization and communication 
capabilities for processes running at different network nodes.
RIPC provides wide set of standard primitives:
semaphore, event, FIFO queue, barrier, shared memory, shared and exclusive locks.
<P>

<H2><A NAME = "struct">Structure of RIPC package</A></H2>

RIPC package consists of two libraries:<P>

<DL>
<DT><code>ripcclient.lib</code><DD>Provides stubs of RIPC primitives sending requests to the server
<DT><code>ripcserver.lib</code><DD>Server implementation of RIPC primitives
</DL><P>

RIPC supports local and remote sessions. Remote sessions
created by <code>RIPCClientFactory</code> class
establish connection with the server through TCP/IP stream socket.
Server process should be started before clients.
In this case primitives at local computer servers as stubs and redirect 
requests to the server.
This mode is useful to provide synchronization and communication
between several processes at the same or different computers.<P>

Local sessions are created by <code>RIPCServerFactory</code>
class. Them are useful to provide synchronization of threads within the same
process (if you want to use more sophisticated synchronization primitives than
standard synchronization facilities provided by OS). 
The single local session can be shared by all threads.
No server process should be started in this case.<P>

Include files needed for use of RIPC package are located in <code>inc</code> directory.
Libraries are located in <code>lib</code> directory. Version of RIPC for windows is
provided with binaries of these librarier and server built by Visual C++ comiler.
At all other system you will have to build these libraries yourself.
Change directory to <code>src</code> and exceute <code>make</code> (for Visual
C++ RIPC provides <code>make.bat</code> file which invokes MS <code>nmake</code> utility
for <code>makefile.mvc</code>). By default static version of librarier are built. To
produce dynamically linked librariers, edit makefile and assign set 
<code>GENERATE_DLL=1</code>. In case of using DLL libraries do not forget to include them in 
<code>PATH</code> (at Windows) or in <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> (at Unix).
Server executable file will be placed in <code>bin</code> directory.<P>

Server can be started by the following command:<P>

<PRE>
     RIPCServer PORT
</PRE>

Here <code>PORT</code> is any free IP port at your system. Server is starts
interactive dialog, allowing you the inspect current state of the server
(<code>info</code> command) or terminate the server (<code>exit</code> command).<P>

It is possible to run server in debug mode. Debug level can be specified using 
<code>-debug</code> option:<P>

<UL>
<LI><code>0</code> no debugging
<LI><code>1</code> trace all exceptions
<LI><code>2</code> trace session open/close requests
<LI><code>3</code> trace all requests
</UL><P>

Default debug level is 1.<P>

It is possible to start server in daemon mode, without interactive dialog.
It can be done with <ocde>-d</code> option. For example, at Windows the following command:

<PRE>
     RIPCServer -d 6000
</PRE>

will start server process in the background. To send commands to the server started in 
daemon mode you can use <code>RIPCServerMonitor</code>:

<PRE>
   Usage: 
       RIPCServerMonitor HOSTNAME PORT [command]
   Commands:
       SHUTDOWN            shutdown server
       INFO                dump information about server status
</PRE>
If command is not specified in command line, server monitor starts interactive dialog.
In this dialog, except SHTDOWN and INFO commands it also supports EXIT and HELP commands.
EXIT command is used to close dialog, HELP shows list of available commands.

Now it is possible to start client processes using RIPC library.
Client should create RIPC sessions using 
<code>RIPCClientFactory.create(char const* address, int port)</code> method. 
Here <code>address</code> is address of the host where server is started and 
<code>port</code> is port listening by the server. Before exit client
should close session. Below is example of using RIPC library:

<PRE>
#inlcude "ripc.h"

void testRIPC(char const* hostname, int port) 
{
    RIPCFactory* factory = RIPCClientFactory::getInstance();
    RIPCSession* session = factory->create(host, port);

    RIPCMutex*   mutex = session->createMutex("my-mutex", false);
    mutex->lock();
    // do something
    mutex->unlock();

    delete session;
}
</PRE>
