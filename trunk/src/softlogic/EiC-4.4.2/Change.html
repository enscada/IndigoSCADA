<b> Changes from 4.3.0 to 4.3.2 (next_release) </b>
<pre>

       * fixed bug with static variables in a file conflicting
         with other variables with the same name but not within
         the scope of the same file:

	     EiC 1> #include t.c  // has static int a1;
             EiC 2> int a1;       // no longer conflicts


       * fixed bug as reported by Victor Eruhimov that EiC wasn't
         explicitly casting all integral types to type pointer.

       * fixed bug as reported by Steve Marthouse from vrml3d.com, 
         that EiC's float conversion mechanism fails to execute 
         correctly:

	        float f = 0.7F;
                assert(f == 0.7F);

       * incorporated Victor Eruhimov's fix to the bug that during
         error recovery EiC would on occassions abort due to 
         some bad memory addressing

</pre>


<b> Changes from 4.2.8 to 4.3.0 </b>
<pre>

  ***** With the help of Al Amzeen, EiC compiles using DJGPP 
        under win32. This provides fairly complete EiC 
        installation, under win32.

    *** Added `void EiC_setMessageDisplay(void (*)(char*))' 
        function. The purpose of this function is to allow 
        an embedding system to control how EiC's error and 
        warning messages are displayed. This is done by passing
        EiC_setMessageDisplay the function it wants used for 
        displaying EiC's error and warning messages. The 
        replacement function returns void and must accept a C 
        style string. The strings passed are stack based and 
        therefore, should either be displayed straight away or 
        copied into a buffer space.

    *** added the `getcwd' function to unistd.h. 
        Compliance: POSIX.1

    *** added SVR4 and 4.3+BSD macro extensions to termios.h

    *** the win32 port of EiC now stores its include files in
        EiC\include. The environment variable HOMEofEiC
        doesn't need to be set if EiC is installed in 
        C:\EiC.

    *** Matt Minnis has added a `:quit' command to EiC and
        is simply an alias to `:exit'.

    *** More externally visible identifiers prefixed with
        `EiC_'.

      * fixed problem with EiC not detecting HOMEofEiC
        environment variable under DJGPP and probably also 
	under win32

      * brought EiC/main/examples/embedEiC.c up todate:
        changed the call to init_EiC to EiC_init_EiC and
        the include path under win32. 

      * fixed compile problems with the FreeBSD port of EiC.

      * fixed one cause of segmentation violation due to certain
        types of errors during declaration parsing.

      * fixed bug with EiC's scanf function as reported by
        Sean McTigue:
             while(scanf("%d", &num)==1)
	        printf("d\n", num);

        getting caught in a infinite loop when illegal input is
        entered.

      * fixed problem with :gen command  outputting the
        function call to add_builtinfunc rather than to
        EiC_add_builtinfunc.


</pre>
<b> Changes from 4.2.7 to 4.2.8  (Jun 12 2000) </b>
<pre>

    *** The win32 makefile systems has had some modifications 
               (still needs more).
        The EiC\config\genstdio.c is now incorporated into the make system
        and is used to generate standard header files. And EiC\main\main.c
        is used rather than EiC\src\main.c, bringing inline more closely
        with the Unix version.
        
    *** The `:clear' command now takes multiple file names delimited
        by commas as its arguments:

             :clear file[,<file>]*
          
    *** More name space tweaking. Most, if not all, externally visible variables 
        and functions, are now prefixed by EiC_. This is to reduce 
	the possibility of name conflicts between EiC source code
	and any embedding system. 

    *** EiC now supports ISO-C signal.h and the signals (SIGXXXX) defined 
        for POSIX.1 signal.h. See EiC's library documentation 
        for details.

    *** EiC's interface to the standard C library functions fgets() 
        and gets() have been made safe against buffer overflows 
        when used with safe pointers.

    *** Added to unistd.h the functions pause and alarm
        compliance: SVr4, SVID, POSIX, X/OPEN, BSD 4.3

    *** Added the standard ISO-C header iso646.h
    
      * removed limits.h and signal.h as they are now completely
        generated via EiC/config/genstdio

      * fixed EiC failure to apply the address operator to functions:

         EiC 1> int foo(int x) { return x;}
	 EiC 2> foo == &foo;  
	         1
      
      * fixed typo in EiC's online :help info for the :gen command 

      * fixed access violation problem, as reported by Eroukhimov, 
        Victor, caused sometimes by an error occuring with the operational
        type with in a selection statement.

      * included missing file EiC/test/EiCtests/teststatic3.aux
        within EiC's CVS repository.
</pre>


<b> Changes from 4.2.6 to 4.2.7  (May 16 2000) </b>
<pre>

    ***	A reset operator has been added. It is used to set EiC 
        to a default internal state. All memory is freed, the 
        contents of include files and global variables, allocated, 
        included and declared, after the reset point, are removed. Any
	global scalar variables declared prior to the reset point will have 
        their previous values restored. The default reset point is equivalent
        to starting EiC with the -N command line switch:

	     EiC > :reset  // regain a previous state

	It is also possible for the user to define the `reset point'
        by using the `:reset here' command:

	   EiC 1> int p = 66;
	   EiC 2> :reset here // set reset state
           EiC 3> p = 88;
                  88
	   EiC 4> :reset
	   EiC 5> p;
	          66

        see EiC's documentation for further details and gotchas.


      * documentation updated to reflect the `:reset' command.

      * termio and termios.h files have been updated on the Linux
        platform to conform with libc6.

      * fixed problem as reported Eroukhimov, Victor that 
        EiC's source file src/assertp.h fails to define 
        assertp when NDEBUG is defined. 

      * Applied Ken Settle's patch that corrected EiC's 
        failure to diagnose:

            EiC 1> 0 (15); //Function names cannot be constants

      * Applied Kaz Kylheku's patch to rid EiC's source code
        of many externally visible variables, by converting all 
        object and function declarations, where possible, to static.
        This is important as it reduces the possibility of name
        conflicts between EiC source code and any embedding
        system. It also removed several dead function and variable 
        definitions.

      * Further refinement to prevent name clashes between
        private and public object and function definitions
        between EiC functions. 

</pre>
<b> Changes from 4.2.1 to 4.2.6  (Mar 25 2000) </b>

<pre>

   ***  The module termios.h has been interfaced to EiC.
        This allows for serial port programming under Unix.     

   ***  The :gen command has now an extra option, `num', which
        controls the number of multiplex callbacks generated:

          :gen <include_file> [num] ["<output_file>"]

        both num and output_file are optional. the 
	default value for num is 1.

      * Fixed problem reported by Sreeni R. Nair
        with a typedef clash  between SunOS header file
        and eicval.h

      * Fixed the following bugs as reported by 
        Victor Eroukhimov:

        1, EiC fails to diagnose:
            EiC > char a[5][];
	2, That char a[3][] = {"abc", "def"}; causes
           EiC to abort.
	3, That EiC was not initialising char pointers correctly
           during declaration:
              EiC > char a[] = "adsf"; char *b = a;
              EiC > b == a;

      * documentation update and corrections.

      * Fixed bug associated with EiC's :show command
        causing illegal storage access when display
        struct, union or enum tag specifiers.

      * Fixed the following bugs as reported by 
        Kaz Kylheku:

        1, that EiC at times fails to parse character 
           literals correctly:
	     EiC > int x;
             EiC > assert(x == '\'');
        2, that EiC failed to assign pointers to builtin 
           code correctly:
	     EiC > int (*p)(const char *fmt, ...) = printf;
	   where printf is a builtin function.	
       3, that ULONG_MAX definition on the win32 was 
          incorrect
       4, that static variables declared in a file not 
          always being hidden from clashes with other objects
          declared with the same name but within other
          files. 
       5, function runEIC in starteic.c has a little transgression related
          to the use of the setjmp macro:
	      if ((E = setjmp(env)) == 0) {
                  /*...*/
              } else if (E == _Err_) {
                }

       * Applied David Ell's patch that removed 
         hard coded directory 
         reference in the EiC/src/Makefile.

<b> Changes from 4.2.0 to 4.2.1  (Jan 14 2000) </b>

<pre>
 ******  EiC now supports setjmp.h

 ******  EiC now supports gotos and labels as specified by ANSI-C.

 ****** EiC's parser can now handle LL(N) grammar, Previously it was
         only able to parse an LL(1) type grammar. This change in
         principle enables more easily language enhancements and
         extentions. N is specified via the definition of MAX_TOKENS
         in EiC/src/lexer.h and is currently set to 3.


    ***  added the function `putenv' to stdlib.h
         Compliance: SVID 3, POSIX, BSD 4.3

    ***  added the function `strdup' to string.h
         Compliance: SVID 3,  BSD 4.3.      

    ***  Documentation updated to reflect the addition of setjmp.h, 
         gotos, putenv and strdup.

      * for the win32 port, added missing file sys/time.h

      * fixed bug as reported by Victor that EiC doesn't handle error
        recovery correctly with respect to the removal of 
        prototypes to builtin functions.       

      * Incorporated Ken Settle's patch enabling EiC to handle correctly:
            
            EiC 1> #define FOO int
            EiC 2> FOO (*a)(FOO x);


      * Fixed bug with EiC_parseString, as reported by Kester McKinney,
        failing to allocate on occassions sufficient buffer space for 
        passing the format string.

      *  Fixed bug with EiC failing to diagnose correctly: 
         passing indirectly an unsafe pointer to a function
         expecting indirectly a safe pointer or vice versa:

              EiC 1> char * * p;
              EiC 2> char * *unsafe q;
              EiC 3> void f1(char * * p) {1;}
              EiC 4> void f2(char * *unsafe q) {1;}
              EiC 5> f1(p);   // okay
              EiC 6> f1(q);   // error
              EiC 7> f2(p);   // error
              EiC 8> f2(q);   // okay

         For more information see EiC's documentation covering
         pointers: www.pobox.com/~eic/EiC

      *  Fixed bug with EiC's address, `@', operator failing to 
         handle more  compilcated data types properly:

             char *vec[] = {"hello", "world"};
             char *p[2]  @ &vec;

      *  Fixed problem related to David Binette's report of a 
         security concern with respect to EiC's demo cgi program 
         `uploadfile.eic.cgi'

      *  Fixed bug with the definition of CLOCKS_PER_SEC on the 
         Linux platform as reported by Derek Simkowiak.

      *  Fixed several causes of EiC reporting memory violations
         when compiling C code with errors coinciding with
         implicit or explicit variable casts.

</pre>
<b>Changes from 4.1.2 to 4.2.0 (Aug 2 1999)</b>
<pre>

 ******  Jean-Bruno Richard has modified EiC's `:gen' command so 
         that it now automatically handles multiplexed callbacks.

    ***  The WIN32 binary distribution of EiC also includes eic.lib
         to enable embedding eic, see file c:\eic\examples\embedEiC.c

    ***  EiC/config/genstdio now also generates limit.h
         and float.h 

    ***  EiC's builtin function popen and pclose have been ported to 
         the WIN32 platform
      
      *  several unused files have been removed from the distribution:

               EiC/module/stdClib/src/fopen.c
               EiC/module/stdClib/src/scanf.c
         
         the following files were removed as they are automatically
         generated at compile time.

               EiC/module/stdClib/src/_PLATFORM/stdio.h
               EiC/module/stdClib/src/_PLATFORM/stdlib.h
               EiC/module/stdClib/src/_PLATFORM/errno.h
               EiC/module/stdClib/src/_PLATFORM/stdtypes.h
               EiC/module/stdClib/src/_PLATFORM/limits.h
               EiC/module/stdClib/src/_PLATFORM/float.h
   
      
      *  fixed bug with EiC failing to cast result of bitwise
         negation `~' to `unsigned int' if operand is `unsigned int' or
         to `unsigned long' if operand is `unsigned long'
              
      *  fixed bug with lexical analyzer failing to handle ULONG_MAX
         correctly.

      *  corrected definition of LONG_MAX for the WIN32 platform.
      
      *  fixed bug with EiC/main/example/embedEiC.c
         being platform dependent.

      *  fixed Jean-Bruno Richard's report that EiC
         was failing to implicitly dereference pointers
         to functions when declared as structure members
         during function calls:

              EiC 1> void foo() { printf("hello\n"); }
              EiC 2> typedef struct { void (*f)(); } Test;
              EiC 3> Test *x, y;
              EiC 4> x = &y; x->f = foo;
              EiC 5> (*x->f)(); // explicit dereference old C style
              EiC 5> x->f();    // implicit dereference new C style
              EiC 6> y.f();     // implicit dereference new C style

</pre>
<b>Changes from 4.1.1 to 4.1.2 (Jul 18 1999)</b>
<pre>
    
    *** Igloo, a port of EiC to WIN32 with  opengl support, with 
        the NT4 glu/glut/opengl DLLs by Jean-Bruno Richard, has
        been added to EiC/contribute directory:

          www.pobox.com/~eic/EiCdist/contribute

    *** the WIN32 port now looks for the environmental variable
         HOMEofEiC 

    *** readline has been ported so it works also under WIN32 using MSVC++.

</pre>   
<b>Changes from 4.1.0 to 4.1.1</b>
<pre>

      * Fixed problems with EiC binary install procedure

</pre>
<b>Changes from 4.0.1 to 4.1.0 (Jun 26 1999)</b>
<pre>

    ***  An EiC module to interface to the C-API of MySQL 
         (3.22.22-2) is available from:
           
            http://www.datagrid.com/~eic/modules

  ****** EiC now supports long longs:

            EiC > long long a; unsigned long long b;

         NOTE at this stage `unsigned long long' is simply
         mapped to `long long'; that is, `unsigned long long'
         is not yet properly supported and is handled as 
         signed values. 

  ****** an alien of port of EiC to the WIN32 platform has been 
         contributed by Jean-Bruno Richard.
 
  ***** Ported EiC to FreeBSD.
  

    *** The reliance on the use of the `ksh' shell in EiC's make
         system has been removed.

      * fixed bug with redeclarations of reference variables 
         causing any immediately and previously declared 
         variable in the same translation unit to get corrupted; 
         example:

            EiC 1> int a; int b @ &a;
            EiC 2> double c; extern int b;

            `c' will now be of type `int'.

       * the platform dependent bug with `:gen' and 
         printf's %p conversion character used for 
         interfacing with shared variables has been fixed, 
         by using %ld.

       * fixed bug with EiC's automatic interface generation 
         failing to handle enumeration constants properly.
         
       * fixed bug with EiC's automatic interface generation
         failing to handle the return of unsafe pointers
         correctly.


</pre>
<b>Changes from 4.0 to 4.0.1 (May 23 1999)</b>
<pre>


     *** Debian `deb' and RedHat `rpm' packages for EiC's
         binary distribution are now available from home
         page.
       
     *** updated  EiC's binary installation procedure -- corrected
         some inconsistencies.
     
     *** changed the names of several files in 
         EiC/module/cgihtml/cgi-bin to reflect a more 
         consistent nomenclature.
     
       * fixed 3 bugs as reported by Larry Battraw:
         (1) setting HOMEofEiC in EiC/main/Makefile line 13, 
            via $(PWD)/.. fails when using bash. Changed to:

            HOMEofEiC := $(shell pwd)/..

         (2) Under linux the file dirent.c tries to include 
            "direntry.h" when it really wants dirent.h:

            removed inclusion of direntry.h 
        
         (3) In the stdClib directory, the 
             file stdio.c defines the following on line 66:
             static FILE * book2[FOPEN_MAX] = {stdin,stdout,stderr};
             Gcc complains about stdin, stdout, etc. not being 
             constants. corrected initialisation problem.

       * fixed bugs with EiC's binary distribution installation 
         procedure.

       * fixed bug with EiC's automatic interface generation 
         returning pointers from builtin code properly.

       * fixed bug with EiC'c automatic interface generation not 
         handling          typedefs correctly.

<b>Changes from 3.9 to 4.0 Fri (May 17 1999)</b>
<pre>

 ******  EiC now supports callbacks. That is, it is possible for 
         compiled code to call EiC interpreter functions.  The 
         compiled code doesn't need to be altered. It is all 
         handled through  EiC's interface to builtin code. The 
         basic design  was developed and contributed to EiC by 
         Jean-Bruno Richard.

         The same builtin code can make callbacks to different
         functions, which take different number and different 
         types of arguments, but not to functions that take a 
         variable  number of arguments. 

         At this stage all the basic scalar types and arrays of
         scalars are supported through the callback
         mechanism. Updates and patches will be made available as
         support for more data types are added.
         

 ****** Jean-Bruno Richard also initiated EiC's
         command `:gen', which is used for automating
         the generation of EiC interface code to
         compiled library code:

             EiC 1> #include foo.h
             EiC 2> :gen  foo.h

         The interface routines will be printed
         to stdout, unless the optional string argument 
         is used to redirect the output to a file:

             EiC 3> :gen foo.h "foo.c"


 ****** Mesa/Opengl has been interfaced to EiC via glut. Its
         interface module can be found in: 
              
             www.pobox.com/~eic/modules

         Example code is also given in the module distribution (GL).

 ******* Jochen Pohl has ported EiC to NETBSD and
         Solaris/i386. In doing so Jochen Pohl made the following 
         changes to EiC's distribution:
            ./Makefile
            ./src/Makefile
                - under NetBSD, ksh is installed as /bin/ksh, not /usr/bin/ksh.
            ./README
            ./config/alignment.c
            ./src/metric.h
            ./src/ppc403/include/metric.h
                - renamed LITTLE_ENDIAN in EIC_LITTLE_ENDIAN to avoid conflict
                  with system header file
                - for i386 and sparc, use hardware name instead of operating
                   system to define data size and alignment
            ./config/makeconfig
               - if shell variable PWD not set or empty, set it to `pwd`
               - use cp -f to overwrite read only files
            ./main/main.c
               - define __LITTLE_ENDIAN__ as 1 or 0, depending on whether
                 the machine is littel endian or not. Needed on some tests
                 to get them running on both little endian and big endian
                 machines
               - define __LP64__ or __ILP32__, depending on whether the machine
                 has 64 or 32 bit longs and pointers. Needed in in NetBSD
                 header files to add (untested) support for alpha CPU.
            ./module/stdClib/src/dirent.c:
               - telldir() and seekdir() use long, not off_t. would make a
                 difference on NetBSD, where off_t is long long.
            ./src/eicval.h
               - on NetBSD, use long instead of off_t for offval (because
                 off_t is long long)
            ./test/runtest
               - use either echo -n foo or echo foo\c
            ./test/EiCtests/teststdio.c
               - fixed assertions (STDC requires that the return value of
                fputs() is EOF on error and a nonnegative value otherwise)
            ./test/eicScripts/Driver.c.def
            ./test/eicScripts/script1.eic
            ./test/eicScripts/script2.eic
            ./test/eicScripts/www_eic.eic
              - change path to eic binary to some standard value
            ./test/posix.1/tstfilelock.c
              - use memset() to initialize struct flock to zero.
                necessary because under NetBSD the l_start and
                l_len values are 64 bit, but only 32 bit can be
                set from eic
              - before F_GETLK, set lock type to F_WRLCK. necessary
                because F_GETLK returns the first lock that blocks
                the lock description pointed to by the third argument.
                if this lock description has lock type F_UNLCK,
                 probably no lock will be returned.
            ./test/sniptests/bitcnt_4.c
            ./test/sniptests/bitops.h
              - use unsigned long instead of long to avoid infinite
                recursion if a negative long is passed to either
                ntbl_bitcnt() or btbl_bitcnt().
              - fixed btbl_bitcnt() to work on big endian machines too.
            ./test/sniptests/dbl2long.c
              - make this test work on big endian machines (and, hopefully,
               on LP64 machines).

    *** There is now an Advanced section
        in EiC's documentation explaining how
        to build an EiC module, and how to perform
        callbacks.

            www.pobox.com/~eic/EiC

    *** EiC web page now contains a separate section
        for EiC modules. 

            www.pobox.com/~eic/modules

    ***  The parse_form_encoded function of
         the EiC's cgihtml library module has been modified
         to do buffered IO rather than just single byte
         IO. This improves the speed of this
         function for http file uploads by 2 to 3 fold.

    ***  Several changes and additions have been made to
         EiC's module MathStats.

    ***  The infinite loop that one runs into by running 
         "eic < infile" if there is no `:exit' at the end
         of the infile has been fixed -- kindof. EiC now
         recognises the EOF for this purpose iff the
         Non-interactive flag `A' is used:

              eic -As < infile
         
         Otherwise `:exit' must still be present. 


      *  fixed bug with the address operator
         not working with pointers:

           EiC 1> int b = 22; int *a = &b;
           EiC 2> int *c @ &a;
           EiC 3> assert(*c == 22);

      *  fixed bug with redeclaration 
         error being reported for extern
         definitions of variables declared
         previously as reference variables
         via the address `@'  operator 

            EiC 1> int a; int b @ &a;
            EiC 2> extern int b;

      *  fixed bug with EiC not being reentrant
         with respect to callback code.

      *  fixed bug with EiC_parseString failing
         if called from a translation unit,
         which have strings that gets gabbage collected.
         For example:

         EiC > while(i++<5) printf("%d\n",func());

         where func is a builtin function that
         calls EiC_parseString. The string
         "%d\n", would be gabbage collected after
          the first call to EiC_parseString, and
         before the calling translation is finished.
 

      *  fixed bug with EiC reporting a redeclaration error
         for macros with null token sequence when seen more 
         than once:
         
             EiC 1> #define X
             EiC 2> #define X

      *  Fixed Jean-Bruno Richard's report of EiC
         failing with the unary opertor `+' when
         applied to constants:
         
                EiC 1> #define X 1
                EiC 2> +X;

       * Incorporated Tim Baker's bug fixes with respect
         to handling declared const types within 
         unary operations properly and EiC failing to
         parse if-statements, if the type of the expression
         evaluates to unsigned short int:

           unsigned short a[1] = {1};
           if (a[0])
               a[0]--;

<b>Changes from 3.8 to 3.9 Fri (Apr  2 1999)</b>
<pre>

 ******  Eugene Brooks has helped modify EiC so it 
         builds without using its own headers, and
         no longer defines its own version of the
         stdio functions. This is designed to eliminate
         conflicts between system code and EiC when
         embedding EiC into other systems
 ******  EiC no longer compiles out-of-the-box
         under SUNOS 4.1 or less -- unless your C 
         implementation is ISO/ANSI C compliant           
     **  EiC now also parses `\r\n' line endings rather
         than just the Unix style `\n'
     **  Matt Minnis has modified EiC's show
         routine so that it also displays a variables
         value along with its type
      *  fixed bug with EiC becoming unstable
         when an error occurs during the parsing of a translation
         unit with a prototype to a builtin function.
         This is a fix to one of EiC's most outstanding
         bugs :)
      *  re-fixed bug with EiC not allowing for the
         re-declaration of enumeration types
      *  fixed bug with EiC's restart mechanism sometimes reporting
         an illegal operation when initiated via
             eic -r or eic -R
      *  fixed bug with EiC not handling global scalar const 
         objects properly.

</pre>         
<b>Changes from 3.7.5 to 3.8 (Feb 6 1999)</b>
<pre>

 ******  added the address specifier operator `@':

            int a @ dddd;

          defines `a' to be an integer whose value
          is at address dddd. dddd must be a constant 
          integral express. This will then, among other things,
          allow the following type of call to be setup from 
          outside EiC:
          
             double d;
             EiC_parseString("double d @ %ld",(long)&d);

          At this stage the address specifier can be applied to
          objects or to functions that accept void arguments 
          and which return void:

             void foo(void) { puts("Hello world!\n");}
             EiC_parseString("void foo(void) @ %ld",(long)foo);

    ***  Bret Deck and Eugene Brooks have improved
         EiC error detection mechanism for identifying array bound
         and memory address violations.     
    ***  technical document EiC/doc/tech_docs/typesets.doc
         explains how object types and operators are (can be)
         added to EiC.
    ***  I have rationalised/cleaned-up EiC stdClib interface.
         However, a major revision of how EiC's implements the
         standard C library is under development.
      *  fixed bug with EiC's interpreter not being
         reentrant
      *  fixed bug with EiC not handling typedef types correctly 
         with respect to scope such as:          
              typedef struct { char a; } c;
              typedef struct { short c; } scs;
      * fixed bug with EiC not determining the sizeof
        enumeration types; that is:              
                sizeof(<enumeration_type>)
      * fixed bug with the use of enumeration types
        as structure/union members
      * fixed bug with EiC not handling pointers to
        enumeration variables correctly.
      * fixed bug with EiC not allowing for the
        re declaration of enumeration types.
      * Massaged EiC's tex documents so as LaTeX2html 
        would do a better job in building EiC's
        online documentation. 


</pre>
<b>Changes from 3.7.2 to 3.7.5 (Nov 23 1998)</b>
<pre>

  ****** added the pointer type qualifiers `safe' and 
         `unsafe' to the EiC language. For example:

                int * unsafe p;

         defines `p' to be an `unsafe' pointer or a normal C type 
         pointer, while

                int * safe p;  

         defines `p' to be a `safe' pointer, which is the normal 
         EiC type pointer. 
         Rationale: to make it easier to interface EiC to builtin 
            library functions, which use `unsafe' pointers and take 
            argument types such as: arrays of pointers or structures  
            with pointer members. 
  ****** to control the default pointer type, three pragma
         directives have been added to the EiC language and which work 
         on a stack principle:

            #pragma  push_safeptr   /* default pointer type is safe */
            #pragma  push_unsafeptr /* default pointer type is unsafe */
            #pragma  pop_ptr        /* return to previous ptr type. */

     *** the EiC_parseString function now accepts variable 
         arguments:
        
                EiC_parseString(char *fmt, ...);
              
     *** the howto documentation for adding builtin 
         functions to EiC has been upgraded to reflect
         the usage of safe and unsafe pointer, see:
             .../EiC/doc/tech_doc/builtin.doc
     *** the `p' conversion character in printf now 
         prints out in hexidecimal format.
     *** the `p' conversion character in scanf now
         matches a hexidecimal input sequence corresponding
         to the output style of printf. 
       * fixed EiC's Linux definitons of various system
         types not being libc6 compatible; such as
          `struct stat', `struct dirent' and `struct tm'
       * fixed bug with the casting of integer constants
         to pointers:
                     int *p = (int*)dddd;
         where dddd is a numeric integer constant.           
       * fixed bug with EiC's `:rm' facility
         failing to remove properly typedef definitions
         of array types.

</pre>
<b>Changes from 3.7.1 to 3.7.2 (Aug 23 1998)</b>
<pre>
    
       * fixed bug with internal signal code not being
         GNU libc6 compatible
     *** The PowerPC 403 port of EiC has 
         been incorporated into the main distribution
         of EiC.
     *** EiC now considers it illegal for the 
         function `main' not to return type `int'
     *** In script mode, control is now passed
         to a main function if it exists. This
         makes it easier to run C programs via
         EiC's script mode
       * fixed bug with EiC failing to recognise
         the ISO C additional escape-code '\?'

</pre>
<b>Changes from 3.7 to 3.7.1 </b>
<pre>

       * fixed bug with sys/stat.h for
         SOLARIS and IRIX platforms
       * fixed bug in readdir on the SOLARIS
         and IRIX platforms due to safeptrs      

</pre>
<b>Changes from 3.6 to 3.7</b>
<pre>
        
       * added the unistd.h function chdir
     *** added facilities to interface with EiC
         from other programs. 
         See the EiC/main/README file in the source
         distribution for more details.
       * fixed bug with printf handling:
           printf("%s\n",NULL);
       * fixed bug with strtok due to 
          safe pointers
     *** EiC can now be compiled on a HPUX
         platform thanks to Alf Clement.
     *** The main distribution now has a contribution
         section, that includes a port of EiC for the PowerPC
         403 thanks to Larry Battraw.
     *** Eugene Kim's upgrade of cgihtml (1.69) 
         has been incorporated

</pre>
<b>Changes from 3.5 to 3.6 </b>
<pre>

      *** added module `xv', which
          provides a primative interface
          to xv.         
        * Fixed bug in EiC's test-module
            EiC/test/EiCtests/testinclude.c 
        * Documentation updated to reflect
          EiC's internet programming facility.
        * if EiC is installed in /usr/local
          then the environmental variable 
          HOMEofEiC does not need to be
          defined             
      *** added the command line switch '-e'.
          It is used  for debugging CGI scripts.
          See documentation for details. 
        * fixed bug with fgetc not returning 
          the next character as an unsigned char
          converted to an int
        * fixed bug with EiC core dumping when
          the environmental variable HOMEofEiC is 
          not defined

</pre>
<b>Changes from 3.4 to 3.5</b>
<pre>

      *** added module `cgihtml'
   ****** all global variables and functions declared 
          static within an include file are now private to 
          that file, and are only visible within the scope of
          the include file. Therefore, in general,  their 
          names will not clash with the names of any global 
          variable visible from the EiC prompt or within any other 
          include file.
        * fixed bug with EiC becoming internally
          unstable after passing structures/unions
          by value to functions from scope level
          file:
                EiC > struct {int a, b;} ab_t;
                ...
                EiC > foo(ab_t); // eic is now unstable
        * fixed bug with type conflicts generated by
          declarations of the type:
                int ff(char *ff);
          and definitions of the type:
                int ss(int ss) { return ss;}
        * fixed bug caused by safe pointers
          when passing structures by value
          to functions.
        * rationalised slightly the header
          files in EiC/src

</pre>
<b>Changes from 3.3 to 3.4 </b>
<pre>

      *** added modules `tools' and `examples'  
        * documentation updated
      *** most of the example code given in
          EiC's documentation is now included
          in the directory:
                 ../EiC/module/examples
      *** the installation procedure has
          changed; this is because `eicc' no
          longer exists.
   ****** EiC can run its own shell scripts of the form:
               #!/usr/local/bin/eic -f
               #include <stdio.h>
               printf("Hello, world.\n");
        * fixed bug with enum being declared extern:
                enum rgb {RED,GREEN, BLUE};
                extern enum rgb colour;
                enum rgb colour = RED;
        * fixed bug with the comma operator processing
          syntax of the form:
                foo(),f;
        * fixed bug with boundary affects, due to 
          safe pointers, in `memmove' and `strncpy'
        * fixed bug with eic failing to cast 
          `unsigned int' to `long' properly 
          on platforms where sizeof(int) == sizeof(long)
        * fixed bug with eic to pass command line 
          arguments in double quotes properly:
                % eic main2.c " hello  world  "
        * fixed bugs with safe pointers when dealing with:
                int a, b; memcpy(&a,&b,sizeof(b));
        * fixed bug with using casts with type qualifiers:
                (const char *)p;
        * fixed bug with the incrementing or deincrementing
          of arrays passed to functions:
                void foo(char *argv[]) 
                        ...
                       *++argv;    //bug here
        * fixed bug with the initialisation of char arrays
          of the type:
                 char buf[13] = "\0""1234456789";
        * fixed bug with pp directives of the type: 
                  #if !(hello)
        * for main, argv[argc] is now set to NULL on setup. 
        * fixed bug with the formation of a new macro during
          an expansion that extends across multiple lines.

<b>Changes from 3.2 to 3.3 </b>
<pre>

      *** improved array bound checking functionality   
        * update of EiC's documentation (still needs some work though)  
      *** implemented the <stdlib.h> function `atexit'
        * fixed bug with rename not removing the oldfile
        * fixed bug with gets setting the wrong flag, preventing
          it from working correctly with the rest of the <stdio.h> 
          IO functions.
      *** added the <stdio.h> function freopen
        * fixed several bugs with EiC's <stdio.h> functions

</pre>
<b>Changes from 3.1 to 3.2</b>
<pre>

        * fixed several bugs in EiC's <string.h>
          functions
      *** added the switch -N to stop eic from using
          any startup.h file when started.
   ****** MADE EiC POINTER SAFE (alpha stage) 
        * fixed bug with EiC repeatedly catching
           the same SIGNAL violation
        * fixed bug with the initialising of
          non STR variables

        * fixed defect with showMacro.
        * corrected NULL pointer definition.
        * fixed typo in "unsigned char" 
        * fixed checking of function return type
      *** added POSIX.1 functions `access' and `fcntl'
        * convert to unsigned int for `%b'; i.e. 
           printf("%b",15) ->  binary numbers are unsigned.
        * fixed bug with indexing arrays of pointers with
          the assign operator.
        * prevented interpreter functions from masking 
          builtin functions.
