
EiC under Win32
----------------

EiC has been ported to the WIN32 platform using MSVC++.

Just type `make all' from EiC root directory (E:\scada\src\softlogic\EiC-4.4.2) to build EiC.  No modules are
used.  Then go to src directory, where you can find the EiC
executable, Launch eic, and then try to run the following program :

#include <stdio.h>
printf("Hello world !\n");

To be able to run EiC from any directory you must
place the eic.exe in your PATH list and define the
environmental variable HOMEofEiC (assuming that
you have installed EiC on the C drive):

	set HOMEofEiC=c:\eic

Actually, it is only if EiC is not istalled in c:\eic
do you have worry about setting HOMEofEiC.
