<H2><A NAME="s2">2. What is cgihtml?</A></H2>

<P>cgihtml is a collection of routines for parsing World Wide Web (WWW)
Common Gateway Interface (CGI) input and outputting HyperText Markup
Language (HTML).
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1 What are the advantages of cgihtml?</A>
</H2>

<P>cgihtml simplifies the task of parsing CGI input and producing HTML
output.  Tasks which would normally require several lines of C can be
reduced to just a few.
<P>Additionally, I have attempted to include general routines which CGI
programmers often find themselves using.  Consequently, some of the
complexities of CGI programming are hidden.  On the other hand, if you
want to know what's going on, source is included.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2 Why C?</A>
</H2>

<P>The purpose of CGI programs is to take data and manipulate it as the
web programmer desires.  Since CGI programs are often dealing with
text manipulation, 
<A HREF="http://www.perl.com/">Perl</A> or other
scripting languages is an ideal way
of producing CGI scripts.  (Perl programmers should check out
Lincoln Stein's
<A HREF="http://www-genome.wi.mit.edu/ftp/pub/software/WWW/cgi_docs.html">CGI.pm</A> or 
<A HREF="http://www.bio.cam.ac.uk/people/brenner/">Steve Brenner's</A>
<A HREF="http://www.bio.cam.ac.uk/web/form.html">cgi-lib.pl</A>.)
<P>However, interpreted scripting languages tend to be relatively large.
This rarely has a major effect on the performance of your server
(unless you are a high-traffic site).  However, if this is a concern
of your's, a program written in C is often several times smaller than
the equivalent program written in Perl.  There's definitely a
performance improvement when using CGI programs written in C, although
the performance is not always noticeable.
<P>Additionally, some servers (notably Netsite and Apache) have APIs so
that CGI programs can be written as extensions to the server, rather
than as separate programs.  This greatly improves performance, especially
on high-traffic sites.  The best way to take advantage of these APIs is
to write your programs in C.
<P>Or, you might fall under one of the following categories:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> You don't know Perl</LI>
<LI> You don't like Perl</LI>
<LI> You like C</LI>
</UL>
<P>In which case, you will hopefully find cgihtml useful.
