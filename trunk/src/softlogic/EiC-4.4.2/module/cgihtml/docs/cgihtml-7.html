<P>I periodically enhance this library, and I welcome any comments or
suggestions.  Please e-mail them to
<A HREF="mailto:eekim@eekim.com">eekim@eekim.com</A>.
<P>This library is e-mail ware.  Please send me e-mail if you use this
library; I'd really like to hear your comments.  Although I do not
require it, I would appreciate attribution if you use my code.

<H2><A NAME="ss7.2">7.2 Future releases</A>
</H2>

<P>This library is nearing its final release.  I hope to include FastCGI
support, and API support (for Apache, Netscape, and Microsoft
servers).  I may also attempt to port it to the Macintosh, and I want
to improve generally portability.  I will most likely rewrite the API
in the next major release.  Finally, I'd like to improve the
robustness and fix all the bugs.
<P>If you have any suggestions, I'd like to hear them.  Feel free to
e-mail me at
