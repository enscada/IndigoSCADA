        The main files are:

stdClib.c          inserts the various routines into EiC's
                     symbol table

stdClib2eic.h      prototype for the interface routines

stdlib.c            interface routines.

Information on writing interface routines can be found in
  EiC/doc/tech_doc/builtin.doc.

Also, all the standard header files in this directory are used to
prototype the routines called by the interface functions and are
included into EiC at runtime; for example:


        EiC 1> #include <math.h>

The platform directories essentially just hold  system
header files for each platform.

        Auxillary files:

ctypes.c      EiC's routines needed to support <ctype.h>

strrev.c
strround.c
eicfftoa.c
itoa.c        These files are all used  by the stdio
              _eicUprintf, _Uprintf  etc.

fopen.c     routines interfaced from stdlib.c, which can
            also be called from builtin functions

printf.c
scanf.c      printf support for builtin functions
	     and the EiC interpreter.
