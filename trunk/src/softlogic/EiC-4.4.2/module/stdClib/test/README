
In directory Ptests is the test suite by P.J. Plauger 
from his book the Standard C library that I have put together.


	* EiC's standard C library implementation 
          passes  P.J. Plaugers test suite for:

		 <stdio.h>  <math.h>   <float.h> <limits.h>
                 <string.h> <stdarg.h> <time.h>  <assert.h>
                 <errno.h>
 
           allowing for what EiC doesn't support 
           (wide characters and functional implementations 
               for the ctype.h macros) 
           it then passes Plaugers's test suite for:

                <stdlib.h>  <stddef.h>  <ctype.h>
           
           EiC still does not yet support:

               <setjmp.h> <locale.h> <signal.h>
