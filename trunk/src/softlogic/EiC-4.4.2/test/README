        This directory contains EiC's regression test suite.

Note: this test suite was put together on a Intel-Linux platform, and
therefore, all tests may not pass on all other platforms. For example,
the tests in test/eicSripts will most likely need to be modified to
reflect where eic is installed on your system. 

The test driver routine relies on GNU grep because it uses
the wholeword switch `-w'.

The test suite comprises of a bunch of EiC code "*.c", auxillary files
"*.aux" and regression test result files "*.def".

The `test.sh' script orchestrates the regression
test process. To kick it off enter:

	% test.sh

Now check for failed modules:

	% find . -name "*.diff" -print | xargs more

Also, during the installation of EiC, the script `eictester' should
have been placed in the same directory as eic. The `eictester' script
is just a copy of `runtest' in this directory, and is handy for
generating new test-modules and testing existing ones.


To create a test-module:

	% eictester -g -f foo.c

To test a test-module:

	% eictester foo.c

To get more information on eictester:

	% eictester -h


Basic scripts in this directory:

	script               discription

	runsent         Runs a sentinel version of EiC
                        and is used for validating EiC stability.

	runpure         Runs a purified version of EiC
                        and is used for validating EiC stability.

	batch.sh        Used for globally replacing one
                        string with another in a bunch of
                        files.

        test.sh         Main driver for EiC regression test
                        suite

	runtest         The regression test engine. Is
                        identical to `eictester'.
