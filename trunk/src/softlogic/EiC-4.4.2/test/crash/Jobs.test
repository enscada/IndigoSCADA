Here is an impromptu thing I just banged out. The burden of verifying the
applicant's answers rests on you.


1.      What are the possible declaration type signatures for the function
        main? Answer by writing example declarations of each.

2.      What is undefined behavior?

3.      What is implementation-defined behavior?

4.      How many bits are in an object of char type?

5.      What is a sequence point?

6.      What is wrong with the statement

                a[i] = i++;     ?

7.      Why is it perilous, in general, to cast a pointer to char to a pointer
        to integer?

8.      Name as many uses of the void pointer type as you can.

9.      What four mistakes are made in the following complete program?

                #include <stdio.h>

                void main() {
                        char *p = malloc(10);
                        long x = 3;

                        printf("%d %p\n", x, p);
                        return 0;
                }

10.     What is wrong with this type declaration:

                typedef int (* foo[10])()[];

11.     What is the output of the following complete program?

                #include <stdio.h>

                main() {
                        static char *p;
                        long x = (long) p;

                        printf("%ld\n",x);
                        return 0;
                }
                        
12.     Why is the first of these statements legal, yet the second isn't?

                int x = 3, y;

                y = (x++ == --x);

                y = x++ && x++;

13.     What is the output of the following complete program?

                #include <stdio.h>

                int main() {
                        int pref = 0;
                        char *p[] = { "Hello", "there", "world" };
                        char **q = p;

                        printf("%s %s %s!\n", q++, q++, q++);

                        return 0;
                }

14.     What is the purpose of the   size_t   type?

15.     What is the effect of the following program?

                #include <stdio.h>

                char *dayofwk(int n) {
                        char day[][4] = {
                                "Mon","Tue","Wed","Thu","Fri","Sat","Sun";
                        }
                
                        return day[n];
                }

                main()

                {
                        puts(day[3]);

                        return 0;
                }


It's a simple test, and by no means exhaustive of someone's C knowledge!
But there are just enough snags to catch people who don't really know C.
