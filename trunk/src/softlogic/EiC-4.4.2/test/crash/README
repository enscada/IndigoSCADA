Snippets
---------------
from seebs
 A C compiler *MUST* diagnose the line
        static int i = 1 ? 1 : (++j);
as a constraint violation, but at least the version we have doesn't, even
in "maximally conforming ANSI mode".  Clearly, it is not a C compiler.)


EiC 1> int j;
        (void)
EiC 2>  static int i = 1 ? 1 : (++j);
Error in ::EiC:: near line 2: Illegal initialization: illegal address operation
EiC 3> int i = 1 ? 1 : (++j);
        (void)
EiC 4> i;
        1


----------------
from AJRobb@pavilion.co.uk (Andy J Robb) 
void function(void *p) { while (*((unsigned char*)p)++); }

EiC 1> void function(void *p) { while (*((unsigned char*)p)++); }
Warning: in ::EiC:: near line 1: Possible non relational operation
        (void)

----------------
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
  printf ("The next president will be %X %X\n",
    (15 - ((15+1) >> 2)) * (15*15 + 2*15 + 2),
    2 * (15+2) * (100*15 + 4*15 + (15 >> 1)));
  return 15;
}
