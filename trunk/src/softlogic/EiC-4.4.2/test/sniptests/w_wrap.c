/*
**  This is an attempt at a useful word-wrap function.  It is given an array
**  of characters ( a string ) and it modifies the string, replacing any
**  new-lines found with spaces and placing new-lines where needed to make
**  lines of the width specified, placing them only where there was previously
**  white-space. ( ie. Words are not split across lines. )  At the present
**  time it is rather stupid. 1) It doesn't know enough to split a line at an
**  existing hyphen.  2) It has no clue about how to hyphenate words.  3) It
**  makes no attempt at dealing intelligently with a singly word longer than
**  the specified line length 4) It does not deal intelligently with multiple
**  spaces new-lines, etc. ( eg. has no clue of paragraph separation, etc. )
**  OTOH, it does deal well with unformatted, left justified text.
**
**  Tabs will be considered the size specified.  Note that word_wrap() does
**  not actually expand tabs.  This is only to inform it of the number of
**  spaces the output device will expand them to, so it will know how much
**  they expand a line.  The only time word_wrap does anything with tabs, is
**  if the tab size is set to zero, in which case each tab is replaced with a
**  single space character.  This often provides the most useful output, since
**  tabs will often be in the wrong places after re-formatting, and is
**  therefor the default.
**
**
**  Publicly available contents:
**
**      char *word_wrap(char *string,long line_len);
**          Does the actual word-wrapping, as described above;
**          Parameters:
**            string:     actual string to work with
**            line_len:   length of lines for output
**          Returns:        pointer to justified string.
**
**          void set_tab_size(int size);
**            Set the number of spaces that tabs will be expanded to on output
**            default tab size is zero. (each tab replaced with a space char )
**            word_wrap does not actually expand tabs.  This only lets it keep
**            track of how many spaces they take up.  If this is set to
**            zero, each tab will be replaced with a single space.
**
**  Other procedures:
**      int get_word(char *string);
**          returns the number of characters in the next word in string,
**          including leading white-space characters.
**
**  This compiles without warnings and runs with the following compilers:
**      MS Quick C 2.51:
**      Borland C++ 2.0:            either as C or C++
**      GNU C++ 1.39, DOS port:     either as C or C++
**  As far as I know, it uses only portable, standard C constructs.  It should
**  compile and run with little or no modification under nearly any C compiler
**  and environment.
