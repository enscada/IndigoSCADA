Unix
====

For building Qwt for Qt 2.x you need tmake. On SuSE it is hidden
in a package called qt-freebies. It can be downloaded from
http://www.trolltech.com/developer/download/tmake.html.

You have to set TMAKEPATH to point
to your development environment and run tmake:

export TMAKEPATH=/usr/lib/tmake/linux-g++ # path depends on your system
tmake qwt.pro -o Makefile
make

If you like to build the examples:

cd examples
tmake examples.pro -o Makefile
make

Builds for Qt 3.x need qmake, that is official part of Qt 3.x.

qmake qwt.pro 
make

The designer plugin is available for Qt > 3.x only. You can build and 
install it with:

cd designer
qmake qwtplugin.pro
make
make install


If you like to build the examples:

cd examples
qmake examples.pro 
make

If you like to run the examples, don't forget to install the qwt libraries
or set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH to the lib directory of your local build.

qwt doesn't distribute binary unix packages. qwt.spec is a template
spec file for building rpm packages. Read the comments at the beginning 
of qwt.pro how to use it.

Win32
-----

Please read the qmake/tmake documentation how to convert 
your *.pro files into your development environment.

F.e Qt >= 3.0, MSVC with nmake:
qmake qwt.pro
nmake
cd examples
qmake examples.pro
nmake

Qt-NonCommercial users beware: tmake does not understand the subdirs template
and the .dsp files for Visual Studio are for MSVC-5.0 instead of MSVC-6.0
The msvc-tmake.bat batch file generates makefiles for Qwt and all examples.
Simply type: msvc-tmake

There is a msvc-qmake.bat batch file for Visual Studio users with Qt >= 3.0 to
generate makefiles or project files (.dsp for MSVC-6.0 or vcproj for MSVC.NET)
for Qwt, all examples and the designer plugin.
To generate makefiles, type: msvc-qmake
To generate project files, type: msvc-qmake vc

Qtopia
------

Change "CONFIG = qt" to "CONFIG = qtopia" and continue like for
any other Qtopia build.

Good luck !
