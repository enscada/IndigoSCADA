 Description:
 
 Knuth's floating point comparison operators, from:
 Knuth, D. E. (1998). The Art of Computer Programming.
 Volume 2: Seminumerical Algorithms. 3rd ed. Addison-Wesley.
 Section 4.2.2, p. 233. ISBN 0-201-89684-2.

 Input parameters:
 x1, x2: numbers to be compared
 epsilon: determines tolerance

 epsilon should be carefully chosen based on the machine's precision,
 the observed magnitude of error, the desired precision, and the
 magnitude of the numbers to be compared. See the fcmp README file for
 more information.

 This routine may be used for both single-precision (float) and
 double-precision (double) floating-point numbers.
 
 Returns:
 -1 if x1 < x2
  0 if x1 == x2
  1 if x1 > x2
